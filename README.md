This is a final product of a brazillian course that I was taking

The name of the course is "Mergulho Spring - AlgaWorks" created by "Thiago Faria"

I do have to say that the quality of the course is questionable. It is definitely not the best
Spring Boot course but it worked for me.

I wouldn't recommend this course to any friends, but I didn't fell like searching for a better one.
